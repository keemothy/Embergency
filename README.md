# Embergency
A HackDavis 2025 Project for California Government Operations Agency (GovOps) track. As a team of four, we built Embergency, a web application that locates live wildfires and nearest celluar tower that may be affected.

## Description
Given a user's input city, our application locates nearby fires and return communications towers that are in danger of being compromised, allowing users to better prepare for fire response. This can be applied to firefighters who need to quickly determine where they should go next, along with citizens who want to stay updated on their surroundings.
